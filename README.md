- ðŸŒŸ More about my senior design project: 
My team and I are currently in the design stage of an awesome semi-autonomous all-terrain vehicle. The plan is to equip it with a lot of sensors to collect data about the environments it drives through. Also, as the name suggests, it will be able of semi-autonomous driving. If all goes well it will be able to transport a couple passengers through an environment while they are free to do data gathering of their own, without the need to manually drive the vehicle. As I get further into this project I'll post more details.
